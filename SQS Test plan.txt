Objectives
To ensure the functional interaction of the webpage and that users can edit, delete records via the interface. This should be automated to reduce manual test time.

- Assuming the rows of data are stored and loaded from a database and the interface allows a user to interact with this data by viewing, editing and deleting.
- Assuming when clicking edit the tds become text inputs allowing users to change values. This can then be saved or cancelled.
- Assuming when clicking delete an alert appears allowing users to confirm/cancel the action.

In Scope 
The webpage “https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/challenging_dom”
No other views will be required to be tested
Functional testing will be covered by automation.

Out of Scope
Security / Performance will not be required
Mobile devices will not be required
Other pages are not required

Test Plan
Page title should be correct

Page content, table, canvas should be visible and ready for the user to use

Clicking the button should do

Clicking the red button should do

Clicking the green button should do

Cancelling the deletion of a row should not delete the row

Confirming the deletion of a row should remove the row from the table

Confirming the deletion of a row should remove the row from the table. The data should persist on page refresh

Editing a row and cancelling the edit should not save the changes

Editing a row and confirming the edit should save the changes

Editing a row and confirming the edit should save the changes. The data should persist on page refresh

Automation requirements
Ruby
Watir
Rspec
Pry – Debugger
Brower drivers

Possible improvements to automation
Ran on a local environment
Git pull latest repository for new changes to codebase
Ensure each time the test scripts are ran the local environment backend data is reset
Ran on multiple browsers
